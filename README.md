**Deploy 30+ open-source AI and automation tools on your own server with a single command.** Selfhost AI is a Docker Compose installer for a private AI homelab: n8n workflow automation, local LLMs with Ollama, a ChatGPT-style chat in Open WebUI, AI agents (OpenClaw, Flowise, Dify, Letta), RAG engines and vector databases (Qdrant, Weaviate, LightRAG, RAGFlow), Supabase, ComfyUI and Grafana monitoring. An interactive wizard picks the services, generates every secret and puts them all behind Caddy with automatic HTTPS. A free, self-hosted alternative to Zapier, Make and ChatGPT.

## Quick Start

You need a VPS with a public IP running **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (4 GB RAM / 2 CPU for n8n and monitoring; 20 GB RAM / 4 CPU / 60 GB disk for everything), a domain, and a **wildcard DNS record** `A *.yourdomain.com -> YOUR_SERVER_IP`. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kossakovsky/selfhost-ai && cd selfhost-ai && sudo bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

The wizard does the rest; see [Installation](#installation) for what it asks.

## Key Features

- **One-command install**: an interactive wizard, generated secrets and no manual configuration
- **Private AI homelab**: run LLMs locally with Ollama, on CPU, NVIDIA or AMD GPUs, including multi-GPU; your data stays on your server
- **ChatGPT alternative**: Open WebUI for local and API models, with an optional code-execution sandbox
- **Workflow automation**: n8n with 400+ integrations, queue mode with scalable workers, an MCP server for AI IDEs, and 300+ optional community workflows
- **AI agents and RAG**: OpenClaw (with Telegram), Flowise, Dify, Letta, LightRAG, RAGFlow, Qdrant, Weaviate
- **Automatic HTTPS**: Caddy reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt; services are reached only through Caddy (see [security notes](docs/security.md) for Supabase's ports); optional Cloudflare Tunnel
- **Built-in monitoring**: Grafana and Prometheus with an n8n workflow dashboard and ready-made alerts
- **Production ready**: health checks, service dependencies, `make doctor` diagnostics, and updates that preserve your settings
- **Free and open source**: Apache 2.0, no vendor lock-in

## What's Included

## Installation

**Prerequisites**

1. **A domain name** with a wildcard A record, `*.yourdomain.com`, pointing to your server's IP, configured *before* installing.
2. **A VPS with a public IP address.** Home servers, shared hosting and localhost setups are not supported.
   - Operating system: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, 64-bit
   - n8n, Monitoring, Databasus and Portainer: 4 GB RAM / 2 CPU cores / 40 GB disk
   - All services: at least 20 GB RAM / 4 CPU cores / 60 GB disk

**Run the installer** over SSH:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kossakovsky/selfhost-ai && cd selfhost-ai && sudo bash ./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer updates the system, configures the firewall and brute-force protection, installs Docker, generates `.env` with all secrets, and starts the services. It asks for:

1. Your **domain** (e.g. `yourdomain.com`).
2. Your **email**, used for service logins and for the Let's Encrypt certificate.
3. **Which services to install**, in a checklist wizard, plus follow-ups for some of them (hardware profile, Telegram bot token, Cloudflare token, ...).
4. An optional **OpenAI API key** (used by Supabase AI and Crawl4AI).
5. If n8n is selected: whether to **import ~300 community n8n workflows** (takes 20-30 minutes) and the **number of n8n workers** (each gets its own task runner).

At the end it prints the Welcome Page URL and login (**save them**). The Welcome dashboard at `welcome.yourdomain.com` lists every service's URL and credentials.

## Upgrading

```bash
make update     # pull the latest installer, update images, restart
make git-pull   # for forks: merge from upstream instead of resetting
```

`make update` resets tracked files such as `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, so put your customizations in the places that survive updates:

- **Custom Caddy sites**: `caddy-addon/site-*.conf` (see [caddy-addon/README.md](caddy-addon/README.md))
- **Compose overrides**: a `docker-compose.override.yml` in the project root; it takes the highest precedence
- **Settings**: values in `.env` are kept (except `GOST_NO_PROXY`, which is regenerated to cover new services)

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `make install` | Full installation |
| `make update` | Update the installer and all services |
| `make update-preview` | Preview available updates (dry run) |
| `make git-pull` | Update a fork by merging from upstream |
| `make status` | Container status |
| `make logs` / `make logs s=n8n` | Logs for all services or for one |
| `make monitor` | Live CPU and memory usage |
| `make restart` / `make stop` / `make start` | Control the whole stack |
| `make show-restarts` | Restart count per container |
| `make doctor` | Diagnostics: DNS, SSL, containers, disk, memory |
| `make import` / `make import n=10` | Import n8n workflows from the backup |
| `make openclaw a="..."` | Run an OpenClaw CLI command |
| `make setup-tls` | Use custom TLS certificates instead of Let's Encrypt |
| `make clean` | Remove unused Docker images and containers (keeps data) |

Run `make help` for the full list.

## Troubleshooting

- **Sites don't load.** The server is usually out of RAM or CPU for the services you selected. Check `free -h` and `make monitor`, start with n8n only, and enable other services one by one. `make doctor` checks DNS, certificates and containers.
- **"Dangerous site" warning right after install.** Caddy briefly serves a temporary certificate while it gets one from Let's Encrypt. This normally clears within hours; if it lasts more than a day, check `make logs s=caddy` and your DNS records.
- **Docker images fail to pull.** Temporarily disable your VPN.
- **`make update` fails.** Force-sync with upstream. This discards local changes to tracked files:

  ```bash
  git config pull.rebase true && git fetch origin && git checkout main && git reset --hard "origin/main" && make update
  ```

## Telemetry

The installer sends anonymous usage statistics through [Scarf](https://scarf.sh): event type, installer version, selected services, OS, a random installation ID, and the country Scarf derives from your IP. No personal data is collected. To opt out, set `SCARF_ANALYTICS=false` in `.env`.
